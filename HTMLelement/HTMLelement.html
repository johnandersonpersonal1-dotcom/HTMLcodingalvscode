            "Can i get you a glass?"
            the duck said, "Nah... I'll pass"
            Then he waddled away.. waddle-waddle
            'Til the very next day
            Bum-bum-bum-bum, bum da-dum
            When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
            He said to the man running the stand
            "Hey! Bum-bum-bum, got any grapes?
            The man said, "No, like I said yesterday

            The duck said, "Goodbye!"
            And then he waddled away
            Waddle, waddle
            Then he waddled away
            Waddle, waddle
            Then he waddled away
            Waddle, waddle
